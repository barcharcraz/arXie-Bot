arXie is a Slack bot that browses and filters the arXiv repository for you. You're kept informed on what's happening in Machine Learning and AI with minimal effort.

This production of this bot was motivated by this question in Google Brain's [r/machinelearning AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4w6tsv/ama_we_are_the_google_brain_team_wed_love_to/?st=irvvkvu4&sh=b50d5ce3)

> How do you keep up with the vast amount of work being done on deep learning? Do each of you just focus on one thing or is everyone reading many papers daily? I'm a second year AI master student and I find it overwhelming.

I've taken all feedback from that thread and the [hacker news thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12233289) to make the process on ingesting the massive amount of Machine Learning research relatively pain free.
